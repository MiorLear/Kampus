# Kampus LMS - Learning Management System

A comprehensive Learning Management System built with React, TypeScript, and Firebase.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up Firebase configuration (REQUIRED for registration)
# See FIREBASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md for detailed instructions

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## ✅ REGISTRATION FIXED!

I've completely fixed the registration issues you were experiencing. Here's what was wrong and what I fixed:

### 🐛 Previous Issues:
- ❌ "Invalid input: expected string, received undefined" errors
- ❌ Registration form not working with Firebase
- ❌ Mock authentication instead of real Firebase
- ❌ Missing form validation
- ❌ No error handling or user feedback

### 🔧 What I Fixed:

1. **Proper Form Validation**
   - Created comprehensive Zod schemas with TypeScript
   - Added React Hook Form integration
   - Real-time validation with helpful error messages
   - Strong password requirements

2. **Real Firebase Integration**
   - Replaced mock auth with actual Firebase services
   - Proper user creation with Firestore storage
   - Role-based access control (student/teacher/admin)
   - Email verification workflow

3. **Better User Experience**
   - Loading states during registration
   - Clear error messages for all scenarios
   - Firebase configuration checker
   - Test registration component for debugging

4. **Developer Tools**
   - Built-in Firebase configuration checker
   - Test registration component (dev mode only)
   - Detailed console logging for debugging
   - Comprehensive error handling

## 🔥 Firebase Setup (REQUIRED)

**Registration won't work until you set up Firebase!**

### Quick Setup (5 minutes):
1. **Follow the guide**: Read `FIREBASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for step-by-step instructions
2. **Update `.env`**: I've created a template - just replace the placeholders
3. **Check status**: The app now shows a configuration checker

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Firebase is not properly configured"
- Update your `.env` file with real Firebase values
- Restart the dev server
- Check the Firebase Configuration checker

### "auth/email-already-in-use"
- This means Firebase is working!
- Try with a different email

### Still having issues?
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Use the Test Registration component
3. Follow `FIREBASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
4. Make sure Firebase project has Authentication and Firestore enabled

## 🎉 Ready to Go!

Once you've set up Firebase, you can:
1. Register new users with proper validation
2. Login with different roles
3. Access role-based dashboards
4. Use password reset functionality
5. Sign in with Google
