## Setup Instructions

### 1. Firebase Configuration

**IMPORTANT**: You need to create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Firebase configuration.

1. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory (same level as `package.json`)
2. Add your Firebase configuration:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_actual_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_actual_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_actual_app_id
```

**Without this file, you'll get "auth/configuration-not-found" errors!**

### 2. Firebase Project Setup
1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Enable Authentication with Email/Password and Google providers
3. Create a Firestore database
4. Set up security rules for user data

### 3. Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 4. Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```

## Authentication Flow

### Registration Flow
1. User fills registration form with name, email, password, and role
2. Form validation ensures data integrity
3. Firebase creates user account
4. Email verification is sent automatically
5. User is redirected to email verification page
6. After email verification, user can log in

### Login Flow
1. User enters email and password
2. Role is selected (student/teacher/admin)
3. Firebase authenticates user
4. User role is fetched from Firestore
5. User is redirected to appropriate dashboard

### Password Reset Flow
1. User clicks "Forgot Password"
2. User enters email address
3. Firebase sends password reset email
4. User clicks link in email to reset password

## Security Features

- **Email Verification**: Required for new accounts
- **Strong Password Policy**: Enforced through validation
- **Role-Based Access**: Secure dashboard routing
- **Firebase Security**: Built-in authentication security
- **Form Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation
